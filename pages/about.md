10 seconds. Sometimes that is all you get to inspire someone to vote, to empower someone with a voice, to start a revolution. I grew up on the beaches of New Zealand and I simply would like the young people of today, to live in a better environment than the one we have now.



I travel the world to learn and share different ways to deeply connect with people. I'm so inspired by the work that so many are doing to make the world a better place.



Right now, we are at a fork in the road. Climate change is both an environmental and social justice issue. We have the opportunity to either create a thriving, clean, inclusive, accessible global society. The next 10 years will cement our future. Let's get inspired and organised.

## What I do

I'm working in sales and marketing to get a deeper understanding of people, their inspirations and how to effect change.

#### People

I believe that most people are trying their best. With that assumption in mind, I love to empower people with the knowledge, tools and opportunities to be able to help them achieve their mission. Organising people for political or environmental campaigns is a passion of mine.

#### Sales

Building from a foundation of door-to-door educational and political sales, I've stepped into an inside sales role for a magazine. I'm managing my own sales pipeline and closing sales with executive level decision-makers.

#### Marketing

I have co-ordinated and delivered political communication campaigns across a range of platforms. This includes co-ordinating calling, email and text campaigns for Local and National political elections in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. I bring experience managing large CRM databases. I enjoy using data-driven techniques to analyse marketing campaign targets. I love testing and adapting to new technology.
